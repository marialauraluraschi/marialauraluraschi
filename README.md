# Hello, World🌍. I'm Laura
## About me 
I'm from Argentina, currently living in Andalusia. I'm in the middle of a career transition from crocheter to programmer.
I like things that envolve patterns, trial and error, and rhythm:
- 🕸️ Crocheting (https://www.instagram.com/cabezarueca if you want to take a look)
- 🪗 Music
- 💬 Learning and practicing languages
- 🛼 Skating

## So far in programming 🤖
I took several courses at Platzi (Definitive HTML and CSS, Basic JavaScript, Frontend Developer) and a full stack web development bootcamp at Adalab. There I deepened these skills and learned and worked with several other new ones:
- Sass
- Responsive and mobile first design
- JavaScript
- MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node)
- MySQL
- Git and GitHub
- Pair programming, group project development, Agile (Scrum)
