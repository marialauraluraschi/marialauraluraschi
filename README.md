# Hello, World🌍. I'm Laura
## About me
I'm an Argentinian living in Andalusia. I'm a crocheter (like a human 3D printer) becoming a programmer.
I love patterns and languages. Recently, I discovered coding and found it very connected to both.
(Feel free to check out my crocheted creations on https://www.instagram.com/cabezarueca 🕸️).

## So far in programming 🤖
I'm mainly self-taught, through JavaScript katas and on platforms like FreeCodeCamp.
But I also did a full-stack web development bootcamp, with MERN stack and SQL, where we worked in pair programming and in Scrum groups to develop larger projects.
Currently, I'm studying two courses involving Python: IBM Python Fullstack and the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate.
